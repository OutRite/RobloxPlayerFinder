# RobloxPlayerFinder
A simple, not-bannable game finder.    
## How does it work?
~It just does~    
It contacts the official ROBLOX API and does magic.    
Not sure how, but here's a diagram.

## Can I get banned?
Probably not, since it only talks to official ROBLOX domains and only with their intended purpose.    
If the APIs weren't allowed to be used, why can I view [the](https://users.roblox.com/docs) [docs?](https://badges.roblox.com/docs#!/v1)    
Yeh. It's _pretty_ cool, eh?
# IFAQ
(Infrequently Frequently Asked Questions)
## Ok but why
Mostly as a challenge for using APIs and Python.
## I don't see their server?????
You should probably use this with something like RoSearcher, since it isn't all that useful by itself.    
## It isn't correct?
They just haven't gotten a badge in the game they are currently playing yet. Give it a bit.
## Is this a virus????????
Sure kid
